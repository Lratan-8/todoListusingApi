# Getting Started with Create React App

In this project we have created a react app using api provided by coding ninjas which had some tasks.
We fetched the data from that Api and displayed it in our web application.
After fetching we created to button to handle the tasks, one for deleting the task and other for editing.
We also had a top most bar which can be used to add tasks to the state.
